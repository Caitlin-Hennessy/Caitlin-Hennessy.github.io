              I'm happy to share that I've completed the Advanced Web Developer
              Bootcamp from Udemy! It took much longer than the advertised 34
              hours but I finally made it &#128513; Having worked as a software
              engineer, I already had some familiarity with web development from
              creating or modifying the occasional website; however, this course
              provided a great opportunity to learn front-end skills in an
              organized, methodical way, as well as get more practice with
              advanced tools such as React, Flexbox, and D3.

              In the past year, my family has been spread out among Southern
              California, Oklahoma City, Seattle, and Eugene, OR. I have spent
              time visiting all of these places, and I find the differences in
              seasonal weather very interesting. So for the

              assignment for my web development course, I created a line chart
              showing the daily temperature in each city in winter (February)
              and summer (July), and a set of pie charts showing the number of
              days of rain, sun, etc. Weather data is from

              Each department at the University of Oregon lists its events such
              as dissertations, lectures and seminars, and performances on its
              own website; there is no place you can go to browse events across
              the whole university at once. This app demonstrates a proof of
              concept where events are scraped from department websites with
              Python and BeautifulSoup, stored in a Mongo database, and
              displayed in a calendar with
              <a href="https://ui.toast.com/tui-calendar/">tui.calendar</a>. The
              POC shows only computer science department events but it would be
              straightforward to add more by extending scraper.py.

              As a makeup enthusiast, I love going to the MAC store and finding
              a great new lipstick. But as a scientist, I never go without
              researching the product reviews first. One of the biggest
              challenges when reading reviews on websites such as MakeupAlley is
              that it's easy to identify the most popular shades and the top
              rated shades. But I want to know what the best shades are, where
              "best" takes into account both the number of reviews and the
              average rating.

              Collaborated with a group of three software developers and one
              geology expert to convert a static-HTML page into a web app based
              on Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. We converted the earthquake data
              to GeoJSON format for ease of querying. Rearchitecting the project
              this way reduced the average page load time by 500%. For
              consistency between production and development environments, we
              created Docker containers for the frontend code and database,
              using docker-compose to link them together.
